# Open Non-commercial Animal Identification Scheme (ONAIS)

## How it works

Universally Unique Identifier (UUID)

Scheme: "Domain" / "Suffix"
Sample: pet4.eu  / abc


## Register

Send an email to register your animal: 
register@pet4.eu

It is a strict requirement that the animal is not held for commercial purposes.
You will be asked to supply details about the animal like name, photo, description, residency, and human contact details.
Afterwards you will be supplied with a UUID which the animal should be tagged with in a safe and appropriate way.


## Identify

Just enter the UUID as a URL into an internet browser, e.g. pet4.eu/abc
It will get resolved to https://pet4.eu/abc and details about the registered animal will be shown.
