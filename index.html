<h1>Open Non-commercial Animal Identification Scheme (ONAIS)</h1>

<p>
  The ONAIS system is used to register and identify animals who are strictly not held for commercial purposes.
  Unique identifiers are created for every single animal.
</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<p>Usage of permanently resolvable and online-retrievable Universally Unique Identifiers (UUIDs)</p>

<p>
  Scheme: "Domain" / "Suffix"<br/>
  Sample: pet4.eu  / abc
</p>

<h2>Register an animal</h2>

<p>
  Send an email to register your animal: <br/>
  register@pet4.eu
</p>

<p>
  It is a strict requirement that the animal is not held for commercial purposes.<br/>
  You will be asked to supply details about the animal like name, photo, description, residency, and human contact details.<br/>
  Afterwards you will be supplied with a UUID which the animal should be tagged with in a safe and appropriate way.
</p>

<h2>Identify an animal</h2>

<p>
  Just enter the UUID as a URL into an internet browser, e.g. pet4.eu/abc<br/>
  It will get resolved to https://pet4.eu/abc and details about the registered animal will be shown.
  See a sample: <a href="https://pet4.eu/abc">pet4.eu/abc</a>
